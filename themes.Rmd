## Themes from Scratch

The themes layer controls all the non-data ink on your plot i.e. all the visual elements not part of the data. Visual elements can be classified as one of three types:

* Text: element_text()
* Line: element_line()
* Rectangle: element_rect()

The themes layer helps us to modify not only the visual attributes of these elements -- e.g. color, angle, and size -- but also their positions.
Although we have access to several theme functions, we do not need to remember all of them. We can access these theme function by taking advantage of the built-in inheritance capabilities: themes functions inherit from each other in a hierarchy. ![Theme Inheritance Hierachy](theme_inheritance.png) 

To learn more about [ggplot themes](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/theme.html) and [complete themes](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html) visit these sites. 

### Rectangles

![facetted grid plot](facetted_grid_plot_wt_mpg_cyl.PNG)

```{r rectangles, fig.align='center', eval=FALSE}
# Starting point
z <- ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, col = Species)) + geom_jitter(alpha = 0.7) +
  scale_color_brewer("Species", 
                     palette = "Dark2", 
                     labels = c("Setosa","Versicolor", "Virginica")) +
 scale_y_continuous("Width (cm)", limits = c(2, 4.5), expand = c(0, 0)) +
 scale_x_continuous("Length (cm)", limits = c(4, 8), expand = c(0, 0)) +
 ggtitle("Sepals") +
 coord_fixed(1)
z
# Plot 1: Change the plot background fill to myPink
z +
  # theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = myPink))

# Plot 2: Adjust the border to be a black line of size 3
z +
  theme(plot.background = element_rect(
  color = "black", 
  size = 3)) # expanded from plot 1

# Theme to remove all rectangles
no_panels <- theme(rect = element_blank())

# Plot 3: Combine custom themes
z +
  no_panels +
  theme(plot.background = element_rect(
  fill = myPink,
  colour = "black", 
  size = 3)) # from plot 2
```

### Lines

To change the appearance of lines use the `element_line()` function.

The plot you created in the last exercise, with the fancy pink background, is available as the plotting object z. Your goal is to produce the plot in the viewer - no grid lines, but red axes and tick marks.

For each of the arguments that specify lines, use `element_line()` to modify attributes. e.g. element_line(color = "red").

Remember, to remove a non-data element, use `element_blank()`.

```{r lines, fig.align='center', eval=FALSE}
# Extend z using theme() function and 3 args
z + 
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank(), 
        axis.line = element_line(colour = "red"),
        axis.ticks = element_line(colour = "red"))
```

### Texts

Next we can make the text on your plot prettier and easier to spot. You can do this through the `element_text()` function and by passing the appropriate arguments inside the `theme()` function.

As before, the plot you've created in the previous exercise is available as z. The plot you should end up with after successfully completing this exercises is shown in the viewer.

```{r text, fig.align='center', eval=FALSE}
# Original plot, color provided
z
myRed

# Extend z with theme() function and 3 args
z +
  theme(strip.text = element_text(color = myRed, size = 16),
        axis.title = element_text(color = myRed, hjust = 0, face = "italic"),
        axis.text = element_text(color = "black"))
```

### Legends

The themes layer also allows you to specify the appearance and location of legends.

The plot you've coded up to now is available as z. It's also displayed in the viewer. Solve the instructions and compare the resulting plots with the plot you started with.

```{r legends, fig.align='center', eval=FALSE}
z +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.85, 0.85))

# Change direction
z +
  theme(legend.direction = "horizontal")
  
# Change location by name
z +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

# Remove legend entirely
z +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

### Positions

The different rectangles of your plot have spacing between them. There's spacing between the facets, between the axis labels and the plot rectangle, between the plot rectangle and the entire panel background, etc. Let's experiment!

The last plot you created in the previous exercise, without a legend, is available as z

```{r positions, fig.align='center', eval=FALSE}
# Increase spacing between facets
z +
  theme(panel.spacing.x = unit(2, "cm"))

# Adjust the plot margin
z +
  theme(panel.spacing.x = unit(2, "cm"),
        plot.margin = unit(c(1,2,1,1), "cm"))

```

## Updating Themes

Building your themes every time from scratch can become a pain and unnecessarily bloat your scripts. In the following exercises, we'll practice different ways of managing, updating and saving themes.

A plot object `z2` is already created for you on the right. It shows `mpg` against `wt` for the `mtcars` dataset, faceted according to `cyl`. Also the colors `myPink` and `myRed` are available. In the previous exercises you've already customized the rectangles, lines and text on the plot. This theme layer is now separately stored as theme_pink, as shown in the sample code.

`theme_update()` updates the default theme used by `ggplot2`. The arguments for `theme_update()` are the same as for `theme()`. When you call `theme_update()` and assign it to an object (e.g. called `old`), that object stores the current default theme, and the arguments update the default theme. If you want to restore the previous default theme, you can get it back by using `theme_update()` again. Let's see how:

```{r theme_update, fig.align='center', eval=FALSE}
# Original plot
z2

# Theme layer saved as an object, theme_pink
theme_pink <- theme(panel.background = element_blank(),
                    legend.key = element_blank(),
                    legend.background = element_blank(),
                    strip.background = element_blank(),
                    plot.background = element_rect(fill = myPink, color = "black", size = 3),
                    panel.grid = element_blank(),
                    axis.line = element_line(color = "red"),
                    axis.ticks = element_line(color = "red"),
                    strip.text = element_text(size = 16, color = myRed),
                    axis.title.y = element_text(color = myRed, hjust = 0, face = "italic"),
                    axis.title.x = element_text(color = myRed, hjust = 0, face = "italic"),
                    axis.text = element_text(color = "black"),
                    legend.position = "none")
  
# 1 - Apply theme_pink to z2
z2 +
  theme_pink

# 2 - Update the default theme, and at the same time
# assign the old theme to the object old.

old <- theme_update(panel.background = element_blank(),
             legend.key = element_blank(),
             legend.background = element_blank(),
             strip.background = element_blank(),
             plot.background = element_rect(fill = myPink, color = "black", size = 3),
             panel.grid = element_blank(),
             axis.line = element_line(color = "red"),
             axis.ticks = element_line(color = "red"),
             strip.text = element_text(size = 16, color = myRed),
             axis.title.y = element_text(color = myRed, hjust = 0, face = "italic"),
             axis.title.x = element_text(color = myRed, hjust = 0, face = "italic"),
             axis.text = element_text(color = "black"),
             legend.position = "none")

# 3 - Display the plot z2 - new default theme used
z2

# 4 - Restore the old default theme
theme_set(old)

# Display the plot z2 - old theme restored
z2

```

## Exploring ggthemes

There are many themes available by default in ggplot2: **`theme_bw()`**, **`theme_classic()`**, **`theme_gray()`**, etc. In the previous exercise, you saw that you can apply these themes to all following plots, with **`theme_set()`**:

> theme_set(theme_bw())

But you can also apply them on an individual plot, with:

> ... + theme_bw()

You can also extend these themes with your own modifications. In this exercise, you'll experiment with this and use some preset templates available from the `ggthemes` package. The workspace already contains the same basic plot from before under the name `z2`.

```{r ggthemes}
# Original plot
z2

# Load ggthemes
library(ggthemes)

# Apply theme_tufte(), plot additional modifications
custom_theme <- theme_tufte() +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.9, 0.9),
        legend.title = element_text(face = "italic", size = 12),
        axis.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 14))

# Draw the customized plot
z2 + custom_theme
 
# Use theme set to set custom theme as default
theme_set(custom_theme)

# Plot z2 again
z2
```
