	shorttitle = {R Cookbook},
	abstract = {With more than 275 practical recipes, this expanded edition helps you perform data analysis with R quickly and efficiently. The R language provides everything you need to do statistical work, but its structure can be difficult to master. These task-oriented recipes make you productive with R immediately. Solutions range from basic tasks to input and output, general statistics, graphics, and linear regression.

Each recipe addresses a specific problem and includes a discussion that explains the solution and provides insight into how it works. If you’re a beginner, R Cookbook will help get you started. If you’re an intermediate user, this book will jog your memory and expand your horizons. You’ll get the job done faster and learn more about R in the process.

Create vectors, handle variables, and perform other basic functions
Simplify data input and output
Tackle data structures such as matrices, lists, factors, and data frames
Work with probability, probability distributions, and random variables
Calculate statistics and confidence intervals and perform statistical tests
Create a variety of graphic displays
Build statistical models with linear regressions and analysis of variance ({ANOVA})
Explore advanced statistical techniques, such as finding clusters in your data},

	abstract = {Science and art have in common intense seeing, the wide-eyed observing that generates empirical information. Beautiful Evidence is about how seeing turns into showing, how empirical observations turn into explanations and evidence presentations. The book identifies excellent and effective methods for presenting information, suggests new designs, and provides tools for assessing the credibility of evidence presentations. Here we will see many close readings of serious evidence presentations - ranging through evolutionary trees and rocket science to economics, art history, and sculpture. Insistent application of the principles of analytical thinking helps both insiders and outsiders assess the credibility of evidence.},
