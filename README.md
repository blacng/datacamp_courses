This repository contains courses I have worked through on [datacamp.com](https://campus.datacamp.com). I have worked through the following courses:

| **Course**| **Status** |
|:--------|:-------------|
|Data Visualization with ggplot2 (Part 1)|Completed |
|Data Visualization with ggplot2 (Part 2)| Completed |
|Data Visualization with ggplot2 (Part 3) |Completed|
|Writing Functions in R| Completed|
|Forecasting Using R| Completed|
|Foundations of Probability in R| In Progress|
|Multivariate Probability Distribution in R| In Progress|
|Probability Puzzzles in R| In Progress|
|Mixture Models in R| In Progress|
|Foundations of Inference| In Progress|
|Inference for Categorical Data| In Progress|
|Inference for Numerical Data| In Progress|
|Inference for Linear Regression| In Progress|

I have completed several courses. I will add the code for these courses in this repository soon. 

In _Data Visualization wih ggplot2 (Part 3)_, I really enjoyed the exercises on **Carthographic Maps** with the `ggmap` package. I practiced how to create a Google Maps API and reference that API in rendering maps from R. I will like to explore the `ggmap` package more indepth in the nearest future.
