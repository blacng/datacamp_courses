# datacamp_courses
This repository contains courses I have worked through on [datacamp.com](https://campus.datacamp.com). I have worked through the following courses:

* Data Visualization with ggplot2 (Part 1)
* Data Visualization with ggplot2 (Part 2)
* Data Visualization with ggplot2 (Part 3)

I have completed several courses; I will add the code for these courses in this repository soon. 

In _Data Visualization wih ggplot2 (Part 3)_, I really enjoyed the exercises on **Carthographic Maps** with the `ggmap` package. I practiced how to create a Google Maps API and reference that API in rendering maps from R. I will like to explore the `ggmap` package more indepth in the nearest future.
